          <li> <a> The Political Economy of Retail Electricity Decarbonization in California</a> [<a href="/Papers/CCA_voluntary_greenness.pdf">Current Draft</a>] [<a href="/Papers/CCA_POWER_version.pdf">2023 POWER Version</a>] </li>  
               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> In many economic settings, electricity is treated as a homogenous good. But for
economic policy questions concerning decarbonization, electricity may be better thought of as a
heterogenous product, which is differentiated by the type of fuel used to generate the power.
Many states employ regulatory instruments in the form of renewable portfolio standards (RPS)
that require minimum levels of renewable energy content for electricity providers. I explore how
offering customers choice in terms of the renewable energy content of their power portfolios
might act as an additional mechanism for decarbonizing electricity supply.
I examine the case of California, where a significant portion of customers take retail
service from portfolios containing renewable energy levels in excess of the state’s RPS. This is
driven by the recent entry of Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs), publicly-owned retailers
who procure power on behalf of their member cities, and who often tout environmentally-
progressive reputations. California’s CCAs sometimes set their default procurement portfolios to
have higher renewable content than the state average, and they have the unusual feature of being
opt-out rather than opt-in. I find that CCAs with high-renewable default portfolios give rise to a
particularly large set of demand for green products, as they capture both customers with high
willingness to pay for voluntary green power and customers who are inattentive to the content of
their power. Regression analysis demonstrates that this uptake of voluntary green procurement is
correlated with community income and political support for environmental initiatives.
However, even in a setting with anomalously widespread use of voluntary green
portfolios, the resulting effect does not clearly show additionality compared to California’s
existing RPS mandate. Though CCAs consistently outperform the RPS (with 12% more
renewable energy than the RPS requires in 2021), stagnation or backsliding in other parts of the
sector meant that the state average was actually 1% below the soft target of 35.75% in 2021. I
also find that the high levels of voluntary greenness exhibited by wealthier or larger CCAs does
not translate to less wealthy or smaller CCAs. The introduction and uptake of new “voluntary
green” offerings for retail customers is not without promise, but institutional and regulatory
factors may mitigate its effectiveness in achieving decarbonization goals.</p>

          <li> <a> Pricing Synthetic Inertia: Strategies for Grid Stability in a Renewable Energy Future [with Omer Karaduman, Guillaume Roger]</a> [<a href="/Papers/Synthetic_inertia_extended_abstract.pdf">ASSA Extended Abstract</a>] </li>  
               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> Integrating renewable energy sources into electricity systems introduces challenges such
as intermittent power generation. These challenges are not only confined to energy procurement but also impact grid stability, particularly in terms of frequency regulation. When frequency disturbances occur, an immediate (sub-second) power exchange known as an inertial response helps mitigate the rate of change of frequency. Traditional power generators like coal and natural gas plants provide the necessary inertia to dampen frequency changes, but this feature is absent in renewable sources. As renewables increasingly displace fossil fuels, the lack of sufficient inertia becomes a concern for grid operators and policymakers.
This study examines the potential of battery energy storage systems in supplying synthetic inertia, offering a fast-responding power injection to mimic traditional generators’ inertial response.</p>

          <li> <a> Trends and Drivers of Utility Costs in California [with Madalsa Singh, Rayan Sud]</a> [<a href="/Papers/FIXTHISLINK.pdf">SSRN</a>] </li>  
               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> Electricity affordability is a salient policy concern in California. We compare drivers of increasing utility costs for three types of power providers in California: investor-owned utilities (IOUs), publicly-owned utilities (POUs), and community choice aggregators (CCAs). Since 2019, the IOU and CCA residential baseline electricity rates have increased by 44-80% after accounting for inflation, making them some of the most expensive power providers in the United States. POU prices, however, remained nearly unchanged. We compare long-term trends in capital assets, returns, and operation & maintenance expenses to identify sources of increasing utility costs contributing to rising electricity prices in the state. Across IOUs, generation capital assets have declined, and fuel and power purchase expenses have increased but are within historical ranges. Transmission and distribution (T&D) expenses have increased significantly and are the majority of overall costs. T&D operations and maintenance spiked post wildfires after years of remaining constant despite an aging and expanding electricity grid.  CCAs reach price parity with IOUs due to the high costs of T&D infrastructure they share and exit fees levied on them. POUs, servicing smaller territories with low wildfire risks, also expanded their T&D capital assets, operations, and maintenance expenses, but the increase is modest. We foresee continued price divergence among power providers due to wildfire mitigation costs, which will have important affordability consequences.

          <li> <a> The Costs of Building Decarbonization Policy Proposals for California Natural Gas Ratepayers: Identifying Cost-effective Paths to a Zero Carbon Building Fleet [with Michael Wara, Michael Mastrandrea]</a> [<a href="https://woodsinstitute.stanford.edu/system/files/publications/Building_Decarbonization_Policy_CA_Natural_Gas_Ratepayers_Whitepaper.pdf">Whitepaper</a>] </li>  
               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> This study quantifies the potential increases in residential natural gas rates associated with building decarbonization
approaches under consideration by policy makers in California. We conclude that planned system safety investments
and some but not all potential decarbonization policies may pose serious affordability challenges to California consumers
over time, exacerbating affordability challenges that already exist for lower income communities and customers. Policy
alternatives that affect existing buildings, as opposed to only targeting new construction, result in greater rate increases
while also achieving greater emission reductions. Our analysis also suggests that strategically shrinking the size of
the natural gas distribution system could be a promising cost- and emissions-mitigation measure that leads to greater
emission reductions while moderating rate increases. However, we note that system retirement will require intensive
planning and regulatory change in order to execute successfully. Our results highlight the need for a gas transition
strategy that involves actively protecting customers from rate increases.</p>
